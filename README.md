# Public Transport Ridership Analysis and Forecasting

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project analyzes and forecasts daily passenger journeys for a public transport system using the provided dataset (`Daily_Public_Transport_Passenger_Journeys.csv`). The analysis identifies key trends and seasonal patterns, while the forecasting model predicts ridership for the next 7 days across five key service types.

This repository includes:
* **Data Analysis & Insights:** A report on key ridership patterns.
* **Time Series Forecasting:** A multi-output forecasting model built in a Jupyter Notebook.
* **Technical Report:** A detailed explanation of the forecasting algorithm used (LightGBM).

## 📊 Key Insights

(A summary of the insights from `reports/insights_report.md`)

1.  **COVID-19 Impact:** A massive drop in ridership is visible in early 2020, with a long and gradual recovery that continues into 2024.
2.  **Service Dominance:** `Rapid Route` and `Local Route` are the primary services, accounting for the vast majority of all passenger journeys.
3.  **Strong Weekly Seasonality:** All services show a dramatic drop on weekends. `Peak Service` and `School` routes drop to near-zero, confirming their weekday-only operation.
4.  **Holiday-Driven Patterns:** Ridership consistently plummets during major holidays, especially Christmas and New Year's Day.

## 📈 7-Day Forecast
